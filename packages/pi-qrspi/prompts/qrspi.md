description: Start a full QRSPI planning workflow (Question → Research → Design → Structure → Plan) with a human checkpoint after each phase, and iterate on revision requests.
argument-hint: '"<topic>" [slug] [ticket]'
---

Load the `planning-workflow` skill (read its `SKILL.md`; templates live under `templates/`). If your environment provides a subagent extension or skill, load it for environment-specific orchestration mechanics; the contract below is written generically and must not assume any particular one.

## Arguments

- `$1` — topic to be planned (required). If the topic contains spaces, wrap it in quotes (`/qrspi "add payment flow"`) — unquoted words split into separate arguments.
- `${2:-}` — slug: short kebab-case identifier for the feature (e.g. `add-payment-flow`). If absent, derive one from the topic after the Q phase.
- `${3:-}` — ticket: issue reference to attach to all artifacts (e.g. `ENG-123`). Optional.

## Role

You are the orchestrator. You own the session: questions, checkpoints, and the summary. You do NOT produce phase artifacts yourself — each phase runs in its own fresh-context subagent, so exploration and drafting never pollute your context.

## Execution Model

Run each phase (R, D, S, P, I) in a **separate fresh-context subagent** when your environment provides subagent execution — use whatever subagent extension or mechanism your platform exposes (the environment's default subagent invocation if none is configured). This is the main flow — fall back to inline execution only when no subagent capability exists.

Per phase launch:

- One phase per run, sequential: launch the child in the foreground (blocking) and wait for it to finish, then checkpoint. Do not parallelize phases and do not background phase work — every checkpoint is human-gated.
- Pass `context: 'fresh'` so the child carries no session history, and `cwd: <worktree-root>` so it reads and writes the same tree.
- Pass `skill: 'planning-workflow'` (add `tdd` for P and I) so the child can load the templates.
- The task text must be self-contained: the phase, the template to follow, the input artifact paths from prior phases, the slug, the ticket (if any), the output path `.qrspi/<kind>/<slug>.md`, and the return contract (inline summary, open questions, anything the orchestrator must relay to the user).
- Children write the artifacts themselves. The extension stamps the `YYYYMMDD-` prefix and frontmatter on their writes too — it is shared by the orchestrator session and its subagents.

## Artifact Preview Rule

After each phase subagent completes, READ the artifact back from disk and present it in full to the user before the checkpoint — stamped frontmatter included. Never ask for checkpoint approval without the artifact content visible in the session.

## Phases

Execute in order. **Ask the user for approval at each checkpoint — do not advance until approved.** If the user requests changes, revise the phase output and re-present it.

**Q — Questions** (you, inline): Gather goal, hard constraints, and out-of-scope items. Do not save a file. Derive the slug if not provided. Checkpoint.

**R — Research** (subagent): Launch the research phase agent. Task: load `planning-workflow` → `templates/research.md`, research the topic, write `.qrspi/research/{slug}.md`, return the inline summary and any open questions. Then read the artifact back, present it in full, checkpoint.

**D — Design** (subagent with interactive relay): Launch the design phase agent. The child returns its clarifying questions and 2–3 design options in its output instead of asking you. Relay them to the user with the `question` tool. On direction, send the user's choice back to the design agent (resume it if your environment supports resuming, otherwise relaunch with the choice embedded in the task); it writes `.qrspi/designs/{slug}.md` and returns the summary. Then read the artifact back, present it in full, checkpoint.

**S — Structure** (subagent): Launch the structure phase agent. Task: load `templates/outline.md`, produce the outline from the approved design, write `.qrspi/outlines/{slug}.md`, return the outline summary and any unresolved structural decisions. Then read the artifact back, present it in full, checkpoint.

**P — Plan** (subagent): Launch the plan phase agent with `skill: 'planning-workflow,tdd'`. Task: load `templates/plan.md` and the `tdd` skill, produce the plan from the approved outline, write `.qrspi/plans/{slug}.md`, return the plan summary. Then read the artifact back, present it in full, checkpoint.

**I — Iterate** (subagent, only on revision request): Launch the iterate phase agent with the user's feedback as the task. Task: load `templates/iterate.md`, revise surgically, overwrite the plan in place, return the revision summary. Then read the plan back, present the changed sections, checkpoint. If the child reports that the feedback requires a design change, return to the D phase instead of patching the plan.

On completion, follow the format in `planning-workflow` → `templates/session-summary.md`.
